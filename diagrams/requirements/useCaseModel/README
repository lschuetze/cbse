requirements model, what are the possible actions in the system
includes everything what can be done.
A use case can include another by namning it in a step
Use Case Diagrams are useful only as a catalogue or map

The textual structure is prefered by Cheesman (P. 45)
- an identifying name and/or number
- the name of the initiating actor
- a short description of the goal of the use case
- a single numbered sequence of steps that describe the main success scenario
Example:
Name: Make a Reservation
Initiator: Reservation Maker
Goal: Reserve a room at a hotel
1. Reservation Maker request to make a reservation.
2....
3. System provieds availability and price.
....
Extension:
3. Room not available
 a) System offers alternative datas an room types
 b) Reservation Maker selects from alternatvies
 
 Extensions can end with
 - Fail - to terminate the use case unsatisfied
 - Stop - to terminate the use case satisfied
 - Resume N - Go to the step in the main process
 - Nothing - continue with its normal next step (no step is skipped or replaced)
