derived from domain model (business concept model)
- represents the system's perspective on the outer world (more attributes, refined class structures from the system's perspective)
- may lead to a subset of classes of the business concept model, due to restricted responsibilities of the system in the modelled domain (e.g., a hotel reservation system does not handle the billing: this is done by a dedicated billing system, but is modeled in the business concept model)
