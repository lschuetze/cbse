<<comp spec>>, which is be realized by a UML component
Interface types should be displayed as "lollipops".
Example:
<<comp spec>>CustomerMgr --<<offers>>--> <<interface type>>ICustomerMgt (lollipop)
also there is an arrow for the usage of other lollipops, also the component specification defines any constraints between interfaces.

There are also component object interaction diagrams. They describe the interaction between components.
Naming rules:
objectname/rolename:classifiername

All this should more describe the externals of the components. It only restricts the freedom of the implementation designer.
